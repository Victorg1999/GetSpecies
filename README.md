### What is lineage?

It is a sequence of species that form a direct line of descent, with each new species being the direct result of evolution from an immediate ancestral species.

- Superkingdom: It is the highest category in biological classification. It is formed by Prokaryota and Eukaryota.

- Kingdom: It is the highest taxonomic rank. It groups organisms according to fundamental similarities and common ancestry.

- Phylum: one of the main divisions of the kingdoms of living things, it is also the second largest standard unit of biological classification.

- Class: phyla are divided into classes by the most common characteristics among them.

- Order: This is one of the categories of mandatory use, as it consists of one or more families.

- Family: They can be grouped by several genera, by similar reproductive and vegetative characteristics. After "genus" and "species", it is the most important taxonomic category.

- Genus: It is the taxonomic category that groups species related to each other by evolution.

- Species: It is the group of organisms that can interbreed and from this interbreeding a fertile offspring is born, i.e. they can also have offspring among them.
